Born in Istanbul, Yiğit introduced himself to music at 4 via mandolin. He took a break and made a comeback with piano at 5th grade, which became his main instrument. Due to his diverse interest in other art forms he decided to study Visual Communication Design \[BA\] in Istanbul while still keeping his touch with music. This gave him a strong foundation in visual media, which makes him more of a filmmaker than just a traditional composer. After graduation, between studying "film" or "music" he decided to go towards 'music for film'. Thus in 2008 he applied to and was admitted to Columbia College Chicago's '**Music Composition for the Screen**' **MFA** program, where he had a chance to do some intensive work with industry professionals like **Andy Hill** and **Hummie Mann** expanding his vision and improving on necessary skills. On his last semester, where he moved to **Los Angeles, CA**, he had chance to work with **Eimear Noone** and **Mike Reagan**. This short semester was concluded with a recording & mixing session of his thesis project which took place at the legendary **Capitol Records** studios, for the original soundtrack of the short, Marilyn's Dress. After moving to Istanbul, Turkey he worked as a composer on TV ads, films and video games whilst forming the alternative rock band **Plüton'u Kurtarmak**.
